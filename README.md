# Google-Developer-Products-Exploration
[__TensorFlow__](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
<br>TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications. [(More info)](https://www.tensorflow.org/about)

I choose to explore this Google's Product because I've seen the ability to build the reliable model in machine learning, especially in classifying objects. Even though I always build a neural network architecture by myself, I always turn on the TensorFlow as a framework to compare the result with my own construction.

In particular, TensorFlow use the optimizer from KERAS Functional API such as SGD, RMSProp, Adam etc. to get the better parameters in neural network architecture which adopt the advantages from gradient descent mostly. But, this technique sometimes suffer to get the global optimum from function such as nonlinear or nonconvex function (still in progress).
